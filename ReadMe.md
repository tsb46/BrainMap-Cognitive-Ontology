Code dependencies you need to run this code:

1. SVD Initialization provided from the following GitHub page (user: trigeorgis) for semi-NMF: 

https://github.com/trigeorgis/Deep-Semi-NMF/blob/master/matlab/NNDSVD.m

* just the 'NNDSVD.m' function is needed

2. NMF Algorithm provided by Haesun Park on her webpage (and associated functions):

https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hpark/nmfsoftware.php

3. NMF Instability measure provided by Wu et al. (2016)

https://github.com/bdgp/staNMF

* Just the 'amariMaxerror.m' function is needed

4. Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) for graph clustering,consensus procedure, visualization, etc.
